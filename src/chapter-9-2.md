Corporate social responsibility (CSR) is an approach to sustainability that involves taking responsibility for the social and environmental impact of business operations. It involves integrating ethical, social, and environmental concerns into business practices and decision-making. Businesses can adopt a CSR approach by:

* Reducing energy and resource consumption
* Promoting diversity and inclusion
* Supporting local communities
* Reducing waste and pollution
* Ensuring fair labor practices

Approach 3: Sustainable Innovation
----------------------------------

Sustainable innovation involves developing new products, services, and processes that are environmentally and socially responsible. It involves using innovation and creativity to solve sustainability challenges and create value for customers while minimizing environmental impact. Businesses can adopt a sustainable innovation approach by:

* Developing sustainable products and services
* Using sustainable materials and technologies
* Identifying opportunities for sustainable growth
* Collaborating with stakeholders to address sustainability challenges

In summary, embracing sustainability requires adopting different approaches to sustainable business practices such as circular economy, CSR, and sustainable innovation.
